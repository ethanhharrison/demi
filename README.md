## üß† Overview

**DEMI** (*Deodorizing Engineering Majors Intelligently*) is a backpack-mounted personal hygiene robot that detects body odor and automatically applies deodorant ‚Äî either to you or toward the source of the smell around you.

Built in 36 hours at **Cal Hacks 12.0 (UC Berkeley)**, DEMI combines:
- **Environmental sensing** via a TVOC gas sensor  
- **Computer vision & depth estimation** for spatial awareness  
- **Multithreaded embedded processing** on a Raspberry Pi  
- **6-DOF robotic arm control** via LeRobot‚Äôs SDK  

What began as a lighthearted idea ‚Äî ‚Äúa robot that sprays deodorant when things get rough‚Äù ‚Äî became a fully working, sensor-driven robotics platform that blends embedded systems, AI perception, and robotic actuation.

## üí° Inspiration

From our first day in Cory Hall, we knew Berkeley engineering life would be a grind ‚Äî late nights, impossible exams, and caffeine replacing sleep. Personal hygiene? Sometimes‚Ä¶ optional.  
So instead of continuing that cycle, we decided to *automate it*.

DEMI was born: **Deodorizing Engineering Majors Intelligently**. What started as a joke evolved into a serious engineering challenge in sensor fusion, embedded software, and real-time robotics.

## üß© What It Does

DEMI keeps users (and their peers) hygienic through two intelligent behaviors:

### ü´ß 1. Self-Application of Deodorant  
A **TVOC (Total Volatile Organic Compounds)** sensor sits near the user‚Äôs body and monitors air quality. When VOC concentrations surpass a threshold ‚Äî correlating with body odor ‚Äî DEMI activates a **self-application trajectory** on its robotic arm, which smoothly moves the deodorant can to the user and sprays.

### üå´Ô∏è 2. Maintaining a ‚ÄúSphere of Cleanliness‚Äù  
A **front-mounted webcam** (on the user‚Äôs shirt) continuously detects people using CNN-based vision models.  
If nearby individuals are detected *and* ambient VOC levels are high, DEMI determines the odor‚Äôs likely direction, selects an appropriate **directional spray trajectory**, and deploys deodorant toward the source ‚Äî keeping the local air quality (and social interactions) fresh.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

DEMI integrates **three major computing paradigms**: computer vision, embedded systems, and robotics control.

### üëÅÔ∏è Computer Vision
- A **Logitech webcam** captures live RGB frames in real time.  
- Using **OpenCV** for preprocessing and **MobileNetV3** for object detection, DEMI identifies humans in its field of view.  
- To infer distance, DEMI employs **Intel‚Äôs DPT-SwinV2-Tiny-256** depth estimation model, producing per-pixel depth maps from single RGB images.  
- Combining bounding boxes with depth data gives precise **3D localization** of nearby people, allowing targeted deodorant trajectories based on distance and orientation.

### üíª Embedded Systems
- A **Raspberry Pi 4B** runs all sensor and vision logic concurrently using multithreading.  
- **Threads:**
  - `sensor_thread`: Reads and filters TVOC data using an *n-point moving average low-pass filter (LPF)*, calibrated through an affine sensor model for stable odor detection.
  - `camera_thread`: Continuously streams and preprocesses camera frames.
  - `comm_thread`: Maintains an **SSH connection (via Paramiko)** to a remote MacBook server.
- During actuation, both sensor and camera threads **pause automatically** while the arm executes a spray trajectory, then resume when a *‚Äútrajectory complete‚Äù* flag is received.
- All data (sensor, depth, detections) are serialized into **JSON packets** and transmitted for real-time fusion and logging.

### ü§ñ Robotics
- DEMI‚Äôs actuator is a **LeRobot S0-101 6-DOF robotic arm** controlled through **LeRobot‚Äôs Python SDK**.
- The team recorded multiple **joint-space trajectories** for different spray actions:
  - Self-application  
  - Directional spray (left, right, forward)
- The **MacBook server** receives processed odor and camera data from the Pi and decides which trajectory to execute.
- This architecture cleanly separates **low-level sensing** (on Pi) from **high-level actuation** (on server), enabling robust real-time control and safe concurrency.
